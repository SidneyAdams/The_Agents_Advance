This is the Mobile Game Repositroy, Please dowload gitHub desktop and clone this reopistory onto it, then you can make changes to the project locally and then upload them to here to interate on the game as we go along. 

Remember to pull from the online repoistory before you start working on the Unity project, and also before you push onto the online repository, this will make sure two people aren't replacing each other's work
